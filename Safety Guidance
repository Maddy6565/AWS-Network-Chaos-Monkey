Safety & Guardrails (Simple Explanation)
This project is designed to intentionally break things in a safe way.
To avoid accidental damage, multiple safety checks are built in.

1. Limited Blast Radius (Only What You Allow)
Chaos experiments only run on resources you explicitly approve.

How this is enforced:
Only lab / test AWS accounts should be used
Only resources inside a specific VPC are targeted
Resources must have an opt-in tag

Required tag:
ChaosEnabled = true
If a resource is not tagged, it is never modified.

2. Dry-Run Mode (No Impact)
Before running a real experiment, you can test everything safely.

CHAOS_DRY_RUN = true

When enabled:
No network changes are made
Backups still run
Logs and metrics are created
Safe for demos and validation

3. Short, Time-Bound Experiments
All chaos experiments:
Run for a short, fixed duration
Automatically restore the original state

Default limit:
Maximum chaos duration: 60 seconds

This prevents long or accidental outages.

4. Maintenance Window Protection
Chaos is blocked during maintenance windows.

Example:
Maintenance window: 01:00 – 05:00

If the current time falls in this window:
Chaos does not run
Nothing is modified
A log entry is created

5. Automatic & Manual Recovery
There are three ways to recover safely:

Automatic restore after the timer ends
Alarm-triggered restore if health checks fail
Manual panic restore (one command)

Manual restore:
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name sg_restore \
  response.json

6. Safety Promise
⚠ This project is for learning and testing only.
Never run chaos experiments in production.
Always confirm backups before execution.
